# Ft_server

My version of the ft_server project at 42 school to install a complete web server using Docker technology, this server runs multiples services: Wordpress, phpMyAdmin, and a SQL database.

The new version of the ft_server project with all parts.

Feel free to use it to undestand the project, never use it for cheating!
